\title{Approximate variance formula}
\usage{
Vmf(N1 = 37, N2 = 45, N = 16, m1 = 12, m2 = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{N1}{Integer; number of distinct items in urn 1.}

\item{N2}{Integer; number of distinct items in urn 2.}

\item{N}{Integer; number of items common to both urns.}

\item{m1}{Integer; sample size drawn from urn 1.}

\item{m2}{Integer; sample size drawn from urn 2.}
}
\value{
Numeric; the approximate variance.
}
\description{
Computes the approximate variance of the number of matches when \code{w = 1}.
This formula is derived under the assumption of unbiased sampling and is
provided for comparison with the exact variance returned by \code{\link[=DISTM]{DISTM()}}.
}
\examples{
# Approximate variance for unbiased sampling
Vmf(N1 = 37, N2 = 45, N = 16, m1 = 12, m2 = 8)
