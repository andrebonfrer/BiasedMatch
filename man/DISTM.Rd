\title{Distribution, mean and variance of the number of matches}
\usage{
DISTM(N1 = 37, N2 = 45, N = 16, m1 = 12, m2 = 8, w = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{N1}{Integer; number of distinct items in urn 1.}

\item{N2}{Integer; number of distinct items in urn 2.}

\item{N}{Integer; number of items common to both urns.}

\item{m1}{Integer; sample size drawn from urn 1.}

\item{m2}{Integer; sample size drawn from urn 2.}

\item{w}{Numeric; weight of common items relative to non‑common items.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{mvec}{Vector of possible numbers of matches.}
\item{fmvec}{Vector of probability masses corresponding to \code{mvec}.}
\item{sumfmvec}{The sum of the probability masses (numerical check).}
\item{Em}{Expected number of matches.}
\item{Vm}{Variance of the number of matches.}
\item{SDm}{Standard deviation of the number of matches.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the entire probability distribution of the number of matches for
given urn parameters together with the expected value and variance.

\examples{
# Compute full distribution when both urns overlap by 16 items and
# sample sizes are 12 and 8 with weight 2.
dist <- DISTM(N1 = 37, N2 = 45, N = 16, m1 = 12, m2 = 8, w = 2)
sum(dist$fmvec)  # Should be 1
dist$Em          # Expected number of matches
